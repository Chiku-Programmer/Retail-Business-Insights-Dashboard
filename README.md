Description
-----------

This project showcases the design and implementation of a comprehensive Retail Business Insights suite, developed to address stagnant sales and uneven store performance across a multi-region retail organization in India. Leveraging SQL, Excel, and Power BI, the solution integrates sales, customer, and product data into a unified analytics platform that empowers business leaders with actionable insights.

The project is structured into three interactive dashboards:

Sales Dashboard â€“ Tracks revenue trends, growth (MoM, YoY), channel mix (online vs offline), payment mode distribution, and store performance benchmarking. Designed for executives to monitor profitability and regional growth opportunities.

Customer Dashboard â€“ Segments customers into new vs. repeat buyers, measures retention and repeat purchase rates, analyzes average order value, and identifies high-value customer segments. Provides marketing teams with insights for customer acquisition and loyalty strategies.

Product Dashboard â€“ Highlights top-performing products, category contributions, product profitability, and stock-out risks. Enables merchandisers to optimize product mix, pricing, and promotional strategies.
